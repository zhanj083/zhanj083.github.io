	<div class="big big1">Hey. Can I ask you a question?</div>
	<div class="big big2">If we were meeting for the first time today on a train, would you find me attractive?</div>

	<div class="big big3">What?</div>
	<div class="big big4">Yeah, me too.</div>


	<div class="big big5">if we were each other all the time, what do you think would be the first thing about me that would drive you mad?</div>
	<div class="big big6">You know what's going on here? It’s simple - I don't think I love you anymore. </div>


	<div class="big big7">I don't want to talk right now.</div>
	<div class="big big8">Yeah, I'm by myself and happy to be.</div>
	<div class="big big9">Okay, I'm not in the mood - I came here to be alone.</div>
	<div class="big big10">I don't want to talk to people</div>
	<div class="big big11">Not anymore.</div>
	<div class="big big12">I don't talk to strangers.</div>
	<div class="big big13">You are mistaking me for someone else.</div>
	<div class="big big14">Really? I vaguely remember someone sweet and romantic, who made me feel I wasn't alone anymore. Someone who had respect for who I was.</div>
	<div class="big big15">I don't think so.</div>
	<div class="big big16">Really. What is that?</div>
	<div class="big big17">How?</div>
	<div class="big big18">Do I have choice?</div>
	<div class="big big19">No,no,no. Read it please.</div>
	<div class="big big20">Okay stop it. I would never write this - it's too flowery, "Other side of the woods," what fucking woods? What're you talking about?</div>
	<div class="big big21">Okay.</div>


	<div class="big big22">I don’t want do that either </div>
	<div class="big big23">I was afraid you didn’t want to see me</div>
	<div class="big big24">Maybe, maybe, we should meet here in five years or something.</div>
	<div class="big big25">Yes it’s awful…..how about one year?</div>
	<div class="big big26">It's gonna be freezing.</div>
	<div class="big big27">Ok</div>
	<div class="big big28">Six month from now or last night?</div>
	<div class="big big29">December...</div>
	<div class="big big30">Ok, me too.</div>
	<div class="big big31">We are not gonna call or write?</div>
	<div class="big big32">Goodbye</div>


	<div class="big big33">Hello</div>
	<div class="big big34">Wait, I have to ask you this.</div>
	<div class="big big35">Did you show up in Vienna at December? </div>
	<div class="big big36">oh no, you were there weren’t you</div>


	<div class="big big37">Daydream delusion</div>
	<div class="big big38">Oh, baby with your pretty face</div>
	<div class="big big39">Look at those big eyes</div>
	<div class="big big40">Sweet cakes and milkshakes</div>
	<div class="big big41">I am a delusion angel </div>
	<div class="big big42">I want you to know what I think</div>
	<div class="big big43">You have no idea where I came from</div>
	<div class="big big44">Lodged in life</div>
	<div class="big big45">Flowing downstream</div>
	<div class="big big46">I carry you. You’ll carry me</div>
	







	





	<div class="small small1">Sure.</div>


	<div class="small small2">I have an admittedly insane thought. If I don’t ask you this, it’ll be one of those things that will haunt me forever.</div>
	<div class="small small3">I want to keep talking with you. I mean, I have no idea what your situation is, but I feel some kind of...connection.</div>
	<div class="small small4">So how about this. Okay, good...I want you to get off her in Vienna with me. We can check out the town. </div>



	<div class="small small5">sometimes you say things that just go too far</div>



	<div class="small small6">Think of it like a time travel.</div>


	<div class="small small7">Miss</div>
	<div class="small small8">Are you by yourself? Are you waiting for somebody?</div>
	<div class="small small9">Yeah, listen. I've just been checking you out from across the cafe and I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but you're by far the best looking woman in this place.</div>
	<div class="small small10">I'd love to buy you a drink, maybe talk to you, get to know you a little bit... you know. Are you here on business?</div>
	<div class="small small11">Ok.. You have a boyfriend?</div>
	<div class="small small12">Sorry to hear that. God, you want to talk about it?</div>
	<div class="small small13">But that's the thing, I'm not a stranger. No, we've met before...summer '94.</div>
	<div class="small small14">No, we even fell in love.</div>
	<div class="small small15">That's me. I'm that guy. </div>
	<div class="small small16">Well, see, I know something about tonight that you don't know.</div>
	<div class="small small17">Something important. See, I know because I've actually already lived through this night.</div>
	<div class="small small18">I'm a time traveler.</div>
	<div class="small small19">And I get a letter for you from 80 years old youself. you wwant to hear it?</div>
	<div class="small small20">Of course, I mean if you don't want to...</div>
	<div class="small small21">Okay, here I go. Dear Celine, I'm writing to you from the other side of the woods. This letter is lighting a candle...</div>
	<div class="small small22">May I please continue?</div>
	<div class="small small23">I am sending you this young man. Yes, young - and he will be your escort. God knows, he has many problems and has struggled his whole life connecting and being present even with those he loves the most. And for that he is deeply sorry - but you are his only hope. </div>



<div class="small small24">Listen everything we were saying is bullshit. This is all stupid - I don’t want to do it. </div>
<div class="small small25">You don’t either? all right. then, why didn’t you say something </div>
<div class="small small26">All right, listen, what you want to do </div>
<div class="small small27">One year, alright. how about six month.</div>
<div class="small small28">Then, we can meet here and go somewhere else.</div>
<div class="small small29">Emmmm, six month from last night, which is June 16th track 9, 6 month from now, 6 o'clock at night.</div>
<div class="small small30">Yes, it's train for you, but I need to take the fly, but I am gonna be here</div>
<div class="small small31">all right... </div>
<div class="small small32">Em...it's just six months.</div>
<div class="small small33">all right, your train is about to leave. Say goodbye. </div>



<div class="small small34">Hi</div>
<div class="small small35">What</div>
<div class="small small36">...</div>


<div class="small small37">Limousine Eyelash</div>
<div class="small small38">Drop a tear in my wineglass </div>
<div class="small small39">See what you mean to me</div>
<div class="small small40">I am a fantasy parade </div>
<div class="small small41">Don’t want you to guess anymore </div>
<div class="small small42">We have no idea where we’re going </div>
<div class="small small43">Like two branches in a river</div>
<div class="small small44">Caught in the current</div>
<div class="small small45">That’s how it could be</div>
<div class="small small46">Don’t you know me by now?</div>
